# React App (Vite)

Minimal Vite + React scaffold created inside this workspace.

Quickstart (Windows PowerShell):

1. Open PowerShell in `react-app` folder.
2. If `npm` scripts are blocked, either run PowerShell as Administrator and enable script execution temporarily:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```

3. Install dependencies and start dev server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- If you prefer, use Command Prompt or Git Bash to avoid PowerShell execution policy issues.
- This project uses Vite; edit `src/App.jsx` to start developing.
